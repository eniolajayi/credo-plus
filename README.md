# Credo + Web App

Project for the [Credo](https://credocentral.com/) Social Payment Hackathon. Participants are to push their limit and create Social Payments solutions that have the potential to be used by millions.
Our main solution is to add a new payment gateway to a credo product payment link that allows
customers to pay with cryptocurrency.

Other planned features to be included are in the Credo Plus suite are:

- Support for telegram called Telegram Shops.
- Ability to print product cards as Flyers that contain the payment link as QR Code.
- Valuable data prediction and insights on customer purchases.

The service is to act as an extension to the Credo payment API. [Social Payment docs](https://docs.credocentral.com/guides/social-commerce)

This repo contains the code for the front-end app hosted on vercel. Smart contracts are written in solidity and hosted on Rinkeby.

**Built with react and vite.**
